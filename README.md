# policy-gradients-methods

In PyTorch codebook we decided to not concentrate on the "from-the-scratch" implementation of Policy gradient methods since we don't compare optimizers/implementations in our RL policy gradient analysis, usage of Pytorch neural network is generally decided to be the best option nowadays on complex environments. But if you still want to see 'from the scratch implementation' we decided to create a separate training book REINFORCE_implementation.ipynb for simpler CartPole environment where REINFORCE is implemented from scratch.
